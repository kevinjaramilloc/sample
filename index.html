		<summary>My Childhood</summary>
		<p>I grew up in a small city called Cartagena, north of Colombia. It's a turistic place, has many beaches to visit and relax. It's too hot, but if the temperature doesn't matter for you, don't miss the pleasure of knowing everything about this charming city. Undoubtedly, you should know the architectural and cultural heritage of the city by visiting its historic center, which is surrounded by long kilometers of old walls that make up the walled city. The beauty and importance of this Cartagena landscape led to it being declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1984.

		In Cartagena, in addition to feeling hundreds of years of history in cobbled streets, you can explore the impressive Castle of San Felipe de Barajas, which dates back to the 17th century. In this way, you will be able to know almost everything about Cartagena and a detailed description of the city.  </p>
